TODO
====
[ ] Better detection of prerequisites
  [ ] gcc (for gnu global)
  [ ] perl (for substitution and templating)
  [ ] make
[/] Add emacs setups...
  [/] cedet
    [ ] Fix touch makefile issues
  [/] ecb
    [ ] Enable bytecode compilation
[/] Vim
  [ ] Extract as much knowledge as possible from:
  http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/#why-i-came-back-to-vim
[ ] Better UI
  [ ] Use dialog to let user choose what he wants to install (similar to linux
      kernel build system)
      see: http://invisible-island.net/dialog/manpage/dialog.html
  [ ] Many options in UI may refer to the same configuration file (for
      instance bashrc), the setup will use a template and subtitute parts of
      the file accordingly. For instance one could enable alias and history,
      but not ssh-agent launch part of the .bashrc)
[ ] Possibility to run setup.sh directly from a curl pipe (as is the current
   fashion ...)
[ ] Better cygwin support
  [ ] Create a cygwin package with all good tools for developers (as requires)
  [ ] Configure XWinrc only if cygwin is detected
[ ] Better SSH support
  [ ] Help user setup its ssh keys (through GUI)


DONE
====
[x] Add ssh-agent stuff...
