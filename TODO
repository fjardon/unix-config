TODO
====
[ ] Better detection of prerequisites
  [ ] gcc (for gnu global)
  [ ] perl (for substitution and templating)
  [ ] make
[/] Add emacs setups...
  [/] cedet
    [ ] Fix touch makefile issues
  [/] ecb
    [ ] Enable bytecode compilation
[/] Vim
  [ ] Extract as much knowledge as possible from:
  http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/#why-i-came-back-to-vim
[ ] Better UI
  [ ] Use dialog to let user choose what he wants to install (similar to linux
      kernel build system)
      see: http://invisible-island.net/dialog/manpage/dialog.html
  [ ] Many options in UI may refer to the same configuration file (for
      instance bashrc), the setup will use a template and subtitute parts of
      the file accordingly. For instance one could enable alias and history,
      but not ssh-agent launch part of the .bashrc)
[ ] Possibility to run setup.sh directly from a curl pipe (as is the current
   fashion ...)
[ ] Better cygwin support
  [ ] Create a cygwin package with all good tools for developers (as requires)
  [ ] Configure XWinrc only if cygwin is detected
  [ ] Add perl script to generate visual-c++ equivalent of vcvarsall.bat
[ ] Better SSH support
  [ ] Help user setup its ssh keys (through GUI)
[ ] Better install
  [ ] Before replacing the .bashrc, extract customization (after the marker line
      and copy them at the end of the new .bashrc.
      This will solve most of the problems with setup scripts (perl, ruby, ...)
      which updates the .bashrc with host specific lines.

DONE
====
[x] Add ssh-agent stuff...
