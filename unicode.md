Unicode Support
===============

# General remarks

Some command line tools have support for unicode symbols (through utf8).
Eventually the responsibility to draw the unicode glyph falls down on the
graphical terminal emulator. `XTerm` has got very good utf8 support and can use
any _TrueType_ fonts. However installing the font in the `font-config` cache is
not enough under _Windows_. A _Windows_ user must also _unlock_ the font file
if the file was downloaded from internet, and install the font manually through
the configuration manager. The `font-config` name of the font is given by the
`fc-list` command. This is the name to give to `XTerm` through the
`-fa font-name` command line option or through the `.Xresources` settings.
